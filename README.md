# chemostat-ABM

This is code written to perform an agent-based model of rod-shaped bacteria growing in an open-ended chemostat.
The purpose of this code is to model investigate the competition of populations of bacteria in a confined environment.
The bacteria can be from different species with different physical characteristics such as growth rate, division lengths, length, and radius (amongst others).
There is also the possibility to give some variability to the division lengths and the angles at which the cells divide. 

## Papers

This work was inspired by some very nice simulations developed in these works.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

The code is split in two parts: the ABM simulations are written and run in C++, whereas the analysis is in Python.
